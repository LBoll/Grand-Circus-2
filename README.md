Deliverable 2


Hello! I uploaded the file completely from Visual Studios. I tried to copy and paste it from there, but when I put it onto GitHub in it's own branch it ended up look all funky. So under DateTime(GC), and then ConsoleApp4 you should find Program.cs contain the source code for the task of such:

Task: Write a C# console application to calculate the duration between two dates in Years, Months and Days. The user should enter two dates as input, then the program will show the result of the difference in time between these two dates. Show the difference in days, hours, and minutes.

I/O: User will input a set day of the year in the format of mm/dd/yyyy followed by another entry of the same format. Afterwords, it will read out how far away those set dates are in days, hours, and minutes.
